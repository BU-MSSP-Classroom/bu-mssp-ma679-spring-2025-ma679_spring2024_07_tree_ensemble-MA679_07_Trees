```

Here are the variables.

- BAD: factor, GOOD/BAD for whether a customer has defaulted on a loan. This is the outcome or target in this dataset
- Account_status: factor, status of existing checking account
- Duration: numeric, loan duration in month
- Credit_history: factor, previous credit history

- Foreign: factor, foreign worker ( no ; yes )
- Female: factor, female/male for gender

Create a predictive model that predicts the outcome `BAD`.
```{r}
set.seed(77)
val_percent <- 0.3
val_idx     <- sample(1:nrow(credit_data))[1:round(nrow(credit_data) * val_percent)]
# partition the data
credit_data_train <- credit_data[-val_idx, ]
credit_data_valid <- credit_data[ val_idx, ]

## Additional Material

In this section we will look at other popular tree based methods that are readily available.
For classification we will use the iris dataset.
```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(iris$Species,p=.7,list=FALSE)
trainData <- iris[trainIndex,]
testData  <- iris[-trainIndex,]
```

### CART using rpart

There are several implementation of CART but rpart is one of more popular one

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
# Fit CART  Model
library(rpart)
rpart.fit <- rpart(Species ~ ., data=trainData,cp=0)
rpart.fit		
plot(as.party(rpart.fit),main="rpart Model")
```

```{r,fig.width=8,fig.height=8}
#Make predictions using the test data set
rpart.pred <- predict(rpart.fit,newdata=testData,type="class")
#Draw the ROC curve 
rpart.ROC <- roc(predictor=as.numeric(rpart.pred),
                 response=testData$Species)
rpart.ROC$auc
#Area under the curve: 0.8536
plot(rpart.ROC)
```


### C-Tree

Conditional inference trees (CTree) is a non-parametric class of regression trees embedding tree-structured regression models into a conditional inference procedures.  It is implemented in the R package `partykit`. 
You can read more detail here.
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/partykit/vignettes/ctree.pdf

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
library(partykit)
set.seed(23)
# Fit Conditional Tree Model
ctree.fit <- partykit::ctree(Species ~ ., data=trainData)
ctree.fit	
plot(ctree.fit,main="ctree Model")
```

```{r,fig.width=8,fig.height=8}
#Make predictions using the test data set
ctree.pred <- predict(ctree.fit,testData)
#Draw the ROC curve 
ctree.ROC <- pROC::roc(predictor=as.numeric(ctree.pred),
                 response=testData$Species)
ctree.ROC$auc
#Area under the curve: 0.8326
plot(ctree.ROC,main="ctree ROC")
```


### C4.5 

C4.5 is similar to CART and it had it's moments.  C4.5 is different from CART since they use Shannon Entropy to pick features with the most significant information gain as nodes compared to CART that uses Gini Impurity

Depending on your operating system RWeka might not work for you.
And C4.5 is outdated.  You probably want to use C5.0, which is an improvement on C4.5.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# load the package
library("RWeka")
# fit model
fit4.5 <- J48(Species~., data=iris)
# summarize the fit
summary(fit4.5)
# make predictions
predictions <- predict(fit4.5, iris[,1:4])
# summarize accuracy
table(predictions, iris$Species)
```

### C5.0

C5.0 is an extension of C4.5.  It is said to be

- faster than C4.5 (several orders of magnitude)
- more memory efficient than C4.5
- Smaller decision trees compared to C4.5
- Can perform boosting to improve accuracy.
- Weighting: allows you to weight different cases and misclassification types.
- Winnowing: automatically winnows the attributes to remove those that may be unhelpful.

```{r}
#http://machinelearningmastery.com/non-linear-classification-in-r-with-decision-trees/
# load the package
library(C50)
# fit model
fit1 <- C5.0(Species~., data=iris)
# fit boosted model
fitb <- C5.0(Species~., data=iris, trials=10)
# summarize the fit
print(fit1)
# make predictions
predictions1 <- predict(fit1, iris)
```

Summarizing the accuracy 

- Without boosting
```{r}
table(predictions1, iris$Species)
```

- With boosting
```{r}
table(predict(fitb, iris), iris$Species)
```


### BART

BART is a Bayesian “sum-of-trees” model.
For numeric response $y$, we have $y_i = f(x_i) + e_i$, where $e_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$.
For a binary response $y$, $P(Y=1 | x) = F(f(x))$, 
where $F$ denotes the standard normal cdf (probit link).

In both cases, $f$ is the sum of many tree models. 
The goal is to have flexible inference for the unknown function $f$.

In the spirit of “ensemble models”, each tree is constrained by a prior distribution to be a weak learner so that it contributes a small amount to the overall fit.
```{r,fig.width=8,fig.height=8}
library(BayesTree)
iris_sub<-iris[iris$Species %in% c("setosa" ,"versicolor"),]
iris_sub$Species<-droplevels(iris_sub$Species)
iris_test_idx<- sample(1:nrow(iris_sub),80)
iris_test_spec_01<-as.integer(iris_sub$Species[-iris_test_idx])-1
bartFit = bart( x.train=iris_sub[iris_test_idx,-5],
                y.train=iris_sub$Species[iris_test_idx],
                x.test=iris_sub[-iris_test_idx,-5],
                ndpost=200) 

table(1*(pnorm(apply(bartFit$yhat.test,2,mean))>0.5),iris_test_spec_01 )
mean(1*(pnorm(apply(bartFit$yhat.test,2,mean))>0.5)!=iris_test_spec_01 )
plot(bartFit) # plot bart fit
# library(bartMachine)
```

### XGBoost

XGBoost became popular due to its success in Kaggle competitions.  It's essentially a gradient boosting but implemented to perform better out of the box.  Some of the nice features include:

- Default regularization
- Tree growing and pruning scheme allows for multiple cuts
- Computational efficiency by parallelization
- A couple of default choices to make it easier to use
- Handles missing data

However, if you want to go deeper, there are some challenges/concerns.

- Hyperparameter tuning is hard
- Missing data imputation scheme is concerning
- Cannot handle categorical variables

Here is it used for the iris data.
```{r}
library( xgboost )
xx     <- as.matrix( iris[,-5] )
yy     <- as.integer( iris$Species )-1
dtrain <- xgb.DMatrix( data = xx, label = yy )
bst    <- xgboost( data      = dtrain,
                   max_depth = 2,
                   eta       = 1,
                   nrounds   = 2,
                   num_class = 3,
                   nthread   = 2,
                   verbose   = 2 )
predict( bst, newdata=dtrain ) 
```

What gets unwieldy is when you start to tune the parameters.  
Here is the list of parameters used.  Not all of them need tuning, but I hope you understand.

- General Parameters that define the overall functionality of XGBoost.
  - booster [default=gbtree]: type of model
  - silent [default=0]: display log?
  - nthread [default to the maximum number of threads available if not set]: number of cores
- Learning Task Parameters define the optimization objective and the metric to be calculated at each step.
  - objective [default=reg:linear] the loss function to be minimized. 
  - eval_metric [ default according to objective ] The metric for validation data.
  - seed [default=0] The random number seed.
- Booster Parameters
  - eta [default=0.3]. Analogous to the learning rate in GBM
  - min_child_weight [default=1] is the minimum sum of weights of all observations required in a child.
  - max_depth [default=6] The maximum depth of a tree, same as GBM.
  - max_leaf_nodes  The maximum number of terminal nodes or leaves in a tree.
  - gamma [default=0] is the minimum loss reduction required to make a split.
  - max_delta_step [default=0]  If it is set to a positive value makes the update step more conservative.
  - subsample [default=1] the fraction of observations randomly sampled for each tree.
  - colsample_bytree [default=1] is the fraction of columns randomly sampled for each tree.
  - colsample_bylevel [default=1] the subsample ratio of columns for each split, in each level.
  - lambda [default=1]  L2 regularization term on weights (analogous to Ridge regression)
  - alpha [default=0] L1 regularization term on weight (analogous to Lasso regression)
  - scale_pos_weight [default=1] >0 for high class imbalance as it helps in faster convergence.

Because of this, there is an automatic versiong of xgboost that does the parameter tuning for you.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
trainData <- iris[trainIndex,]
testData  <- iris[-trainIndex,]
trainData_f <-trainData
trainData_f$Species <- factor(trainData$Species)
# load library
devtools::install_github("ja-thomas/autoxgboost")
library(autoxgboost)
# create a classification task
trainTask = makeClassifTask(data = trainData_f, target = "Species")
# create a control object for optimizer
ctrl = makeMBOControl()
ctrl = setMBOControlTermination(ctrl, iters = 5L) 
# fit the model
res = autoxgboost(trainTask, control = ctrl, tune.threshold = FALSE)
# do prediction and print confusion matrix
prediction = predict(res, testData)
table(prediction$data[,1],prediction$data[,2])
plot(prediction$data[,1],prediction$data[,2])
#caret::confusionMatrix(test$Species, prediction$data$response)
```


### catboost

Catboost is another popular boosting method that in my view popular due to well thought out implementation.
The three features that distingishes itself from the other similar models are

- Symmetric tree
- Ordered Boosting
- Categorical Feature Engineering


 https://catboost.ai/en/docs/concepts/r-usages-examples
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(catboost)
# load data
set.seed(1)
idx=sample(1:nrow(iris),nrow(iris)*.7)
train=iris[idx,]
test=iris[-idx,]
fit_control <- caret::trainControl(
  method = "cv", 
  number = 3, 
  search = "random",
  classProbs = TRUE
)
# set grid options
grid <- expand.grid(
  depth = c(4, 6, 8),
  learning_rate = 0.1,
  l2_leaf_reg = 0.1,
  rsm = 0.95,
  border_count = 64,
  iterations = 10
)
model <- caret::train(
  x = train[,-5], 
  y = train[,5],
  method = catboost.caret,
  metric = "Accuracy",
  maximize = TRUE,
  preProc = NULL,
  tuneGrid = grid, 
  tuneLength = 30, 
  trControl = fit_control
)
table(test$Species,predict(model,test))
```

### Ensemble model

Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting are examples of ensemble models.
The idea is to combine models to get a better result than any individual model can achieve.
So far, we’ve combined the same models, but that need not be the case.
One way to combine the results is to just average the outcomes from different models.
But one need not trust the results from all models equally.
An alternative way is to use the predictions as input into a regression model to create weights representing the level of trust in the model.

Stacking is easy to implement but even easier if you use caret.
For example, if you want to do 5 fold CV to fit random forest, gbm, linear regression and gam, then combine the results.

```{r}
data(Sonar,package = "mlbench")
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = Sonar$Class, p = .75, list = FALSE)
training <- Sonar[inTrain, ]
testing <- Sonar[-inTrain, ]
my_control <- trainControl(
  method="cv",
  number=25,
  savePredictions="final",
  classProbs=TRUE,
  index=createResample(training$Class, 25),
  summaryFunction=twoClassSummary
)
```

```{r}
model_list <- caretList( Class ~ ., data=training,
  			     trControl=my_control,
  			       metric="ROC",
  			     methodList=c("rf","glm","rpart"))
```

```{r}
stacked.model <- caretStack( model_list, method="glm")
predict(stacked.model,testing)

```
